<h1>How to play</h1>
<ol>
    <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>

    <li>You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty
        squares.
    </li>

    <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>

    <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
